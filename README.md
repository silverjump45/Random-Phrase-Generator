##*The Random Phrase Generator*

This is a very basic piece of javaScript I wrote for
a portfolio project on Codecademy. Simple open in node and run to get a
randomly generated phrase from the three arrays at the beginning of the
code. Used arrow notion for my function as that seemed to be Codecademy
standard, but I understand if it looks clunky or is taking up too much space.
